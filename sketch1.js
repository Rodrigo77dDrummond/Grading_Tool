let a = "1. Broad/unspecific claim (AKA, parroting the prompt instead of answering it) Explanation: You may have been taught at some point in your writing instruction to take the question or prompt and (after making it a declarative statement) turn it into the first sentence of your response. Doing so ensures that you are focused on answering the question that was asked. The resulting language is often vague and generic, though. Instead of parroting the prompt, think about answering it. If the prompt asks you how an author uses language to shape your understanding of a character’s feelings, you should name the character, identify the relevant language devices and tactics, and specify the feelings. What to do: Think of the broad terms of your prompt as generalg categories that require specific answers to help you craft a more precise and engaging opening claim."
let b = "2. Using “this shows” Explanation: This construction is overused and considered weak. There’s always a more specific way to phrase “this” and often a better verb to choose than “shows.” What to do: Replace “this” with a more specific term that describes the same thing and choose a more precise verb. Instead of “this shows” you might use “Antigone’s angry reply reveals” or “the violent image suggests. 2b. Using “this is shown” Explanation: This construction combines the issues of numbers 2 and 3 in this list. See both entries for more info. What to do: See numbers 2 and 3 for more information."
let c = "3. Passive voice. Explanation: This is a grammatical issue that weakens your sentences. Instead of the subject “doing” the verb, your sentence is constructed so that the verb is “being done” by something (whether or not that something is named). What to do: Make sure that your subject of your sentence is doing the verb. It may help to search for “is” or “was.” Not every instance of those words will be an example of passive voice, but every example of passive voice will use one of those words."
let d = "4. Using the term “quote” in formal writing. Explanation: This is a matter of convention. We use the term quote in writing instruction when talking about how to write analysis, but we don’t use it in the analysis itself. It’s similar to how you are taught analytical writing using terms like thesis and paragraph, but you don’t write “My thesis is…” or “In this paragraph...” What to do: Replace the word “quote” with another term that describes what is in the quote. It might be an image, a response, a declaration, a description, and so on."
let e = "5. Lead-ins that don’t further your argument. Explanation: The setup or lead-in to a quote should give context to the quote (e.g. when it takes place, if it’s narration or dialogue, who is speaking to whom, etc.) but it should do so in a way that also connects back to a claim and moves your argument forward. What to do: Make sure that you foreground your claim before contextualizing evidence or use your lead-in to relate the upcoming idea to the one you just established."
let f = "6. Quotations that are overly long. Explanation: It’s often difficult and awkward to insert a whole sentence (or more) from one text inside of your writing. Plus, you often really want to concentrate on a shorter phrase within the sentence, anyway. What to do: 1. Only quote the portion of your text that helps you advance your argument. Instead of quoting entire sentences, think about leading in with paraphrase and then including only the most relevant portion of the sentence. This is also called using snippet quotes, and they can come at the beginning, middle, or end or your sentence, and you can also use multiple snippets inside of a single sentence. 2. If it is important to maintain your whole quotation, you may want to use a block quote. To form a block quote, place the quotation in a free-standing block of text and omit quotation marks. Start the quotation on a new line, with the entire quote indented ½ inch from the left margin; Your parenthetical citation should come after the closing punctuation mark."
let g = "7. Calling your text a book. Explanation: This word choice is a matter of convention in literary analysis. “Book” is the physical form or medium of the writing (as opposed to, say, an audiobook). When analyzing literature, it’s usually the type of writing that matters, not the form it comes in. For instance, a novel and an atlas are both books, but the novel has conventions and features that an atlas lacks (like characters, setting, plot, theme, etc.), and those are the elements that matter to a reader of literary analysis. What to do: Instead of calling it a book, replace that term with one that tells the genre or type of book. “Novel” or “play” is often appropriate, but sometimes a more specific genre works as well (like tragedy, fantasy, romance, etc.)"
let h = "8. “Using diction” or “using language”. Explanation: Diction is an inherent quality of all writing, so every text “uses” diction. The term doesn’t actually mean much unless you qualify the type of diction you mean. Similarly, the term language is too broad to be helpful. It’s a little like saying that the author uses words. It’s not wrong, but it’s also not useful. What to do: Qualify “diction” with a specific adjective (Example diction types: Religious diction, elevated diction, casual diction, inconsistent diction) or specify a language device(Example language devices: metaphor, visual imagery, repetition)."
let i = "9. Ellipses in quotes. Explanation: Ellipses (...) show that you have omitted something from the middle of a quotation without changing the meaning of that quotation. You don’t need to use them leading into or out of a quotation. You can choose where to begin and end your quotes. What to do: If the part you want to quote begins or ends in the middle of a thought, paraphrase the rest outside of the quotation. If the original text reads I badly desired to defeat the odious monster you might paraphrase part of it and quote the rest, as in The narrator’s repeated wish is simply “to defeat the odious monster.”"
let j = "10. Citing page or line numbers. Explanation: MLA citation occurs in parentheses at the ends of clauses and sentences. What to do: If it isn’t clear in your text who the author is, the citation should contain the author’s last name and the page number or line number with no punctuation. 10b. Punctuation with citations. What to do: When a sentence ends with a quotation and no citation, the end punctuation goes inside of the quote marks. When a sentence ends with a quotation followed by a citation, the end punctuation goes last, after the closing of the quote and the citation. 10c. 10c. Citing multiple pages/lines. Explanation: Sometimes a single sentence will contain quotes from two different places. What to do: Give separate citations for each quote; place the citations after each respective quote."
let k = "11. Comma splice. Explanation: A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses (each of which could be a complete sentence on its own) are joined with a comma instead of a period, a semicolon, or a conjunction. What to do: There are a number of options, each with situational advantages. 1. Divide the two clauses with a period to show separation or distinctness. 2. Join the two clauses with a semicolon to show a link. 3. Join the two clauses with a conjunction to show a stronger link. 11b. Run-on sentence (also called a fused sentence). Explanation: A run-on is like a comma splice without the comma. It occurs when two independent clauses (each of which could be a complete sentence on its own) are joined together. What to do: There are a number of options, each with situational advantages. 1. Divide the two clauses with a period to show separation or distinctness. 2. Join the two clauses with a semicolon to show a link. 3. Join the two clauses with a comma and conjunction to show a stronger link."
let l = "12. 12.Misplaced modifiers. Explanation: A misplaced modifier occurs when a descriptive phrase or clause is too far from the word(s) it describes (aka modifies). The result is an awkward and confusing sentence. What to do: Find the source of confusion and figure out if it has something to do with one group of words describing another word or set of words. Reorganize the sentence so that the descriptive clause or phrase is closer to the word(s) being modified."
let m = "13. Dangling modifiers. Explanation: A dangling modifier occurs when there is no clear word in the sentence that a phrase or clause can modify. The result is an awkward and confusing sentence. What to do: Determine who is doing what in the sentence, and then explicitly state that subject with an appropriate noun or pronoun."
let n = "14. Indefinite use of pronouns. Explanation: The indefinite use of it, they, and you is common and acceptable in conversation, but imprecise, clunky, and potentially confusing in writing. In this case, indefinite use means that one of the aforementioned pronouns refers to some thing or idea that is implied, rather than explicitly stated. What to do: Remove the indefinite pronoun, along with any other words used to make it fit in the sentence, or replace the indefinite pronoun with a clear, specific noun. Or, use the passive voice, which is sometimes appropriate for presenting objective, common knowledge."
let o = "15. Transitions between paragraphs. Explanation: Even though a paragraph break indicates that your writing will pivot to a new idea, it should still be connected to the ideas that came before it. Paragraphs which lack connections to previous sentences or paragraphs can feel disconnected and confuse your reader. What to do: Use transition words to indicate how your new idea connects to the previous idea. If it is an additional example, use language like “also,” “additionally,” “similarly,” “in the same vein,” and so on. If your new paragraph complicates your previous assertions or qualifies them with more nuance, consider words like “However,” “yet,” or “while” (as in “while X is often the case, sometimes Y is true”). This list is far from exhaustive. In every case, choose your language to show how your new paragraph relates to the ideas that preceded it. 15b. Transitions within paragraphs. Explanation: Transitions are just as necessary between ideas within a paragraph as they are between paragraphs. What to do: See entry 15 for more information. 15c. Transitions through plot. Explanation: If you pivot from one idea to the next one by introducing the next relevant plot event, you’re likely lapsing into summary. What to do: Pivot to your new idea with a claim and use key transition words to show how that claim relates to your previous ideas. See entry #15 for more information."
let p = "16. Topic sentences that contain plot summary instead of a claim. Explanation: The topic sentence of your analytical paragraphs should make claims about craft or effect. If your sentence reports on events that have happened, you’re likely summarizing. What to do: Think of the plot events (or historical events) as given information and make sure to go beyond them in your topic sentences. Think: What do I know because of those events? and include that information in your claim. Also, consider using analysis verbs to make sure you consider craft and effect instead of summary."
let q = "17. Commas between a subject and its verb. Explanation: You do not need to place a comma between a subject and a verb, even if there is a mental “pause” between a complex subject and its verb. What to do: Delete the comma."
let r = "18. Punctuating titles. Explanation: The titles of major works (such as novels, plays, newspapers, magazines, and albums) should be italicized when typed and underlined when handwritten. 18b. Punctuating titles when introducing a text. Explanation: There are different ways to introduce a text and its author. Some ways require the use of commas; others do not. What to do: Use the examples as templates to see how to properly punctuate different ways to structure your introduction."
let s = "19. Commas and quotations. Explanation: It’s a little counterintuitive, but commas that immediately follow quotations actually get pulled inside the quote marks. What to do: Put the comma first before the closing quote marks. Another note: Delete commas at the end of a quotation that are not required grammatically by the full sentence."
let t = "20. Tense. Explanation: The preferred tense for verbs in literary analysis is simple present tense, sometimes called “literary present.” Avoid using past tense or present progressive."
let u = "21. Quotations that contain both dialogue and narration. Explanation: Quotes that contain both dialogue and narration switch points of view in a way that is often confusing for a reader. In a single quotation, readers expect to find a focused, consistent point of view. What to do: There are a few main options, each with situational advantages. 1. If there is an interrupting piece of narration in the middle of dialogue that you want to keep, you can use ellipses to cut out the unnecessary part. 2. You can also separate the quote into smaller snippets in a single sentence or across multiple sentences. 3. If it is important to maintain your whole quotation (if, for instance, your focus is on the rapidness of the back and forth between characters), you may also want to use a block quote. To form a block quote, place the quotation in a free-standing block of text and omit quotation marks. Start the quotation on a new line, with the entire quote indented ½ inch from the left margin; Your parenthetical citation should come after the closing punctuation mark."
let v = "22.  Sentence Variation. Explanation: When too many sentences of the same type interrupt fluency (smoothness of reading flow) or comprehension. What to do: Vary the types of sentences you use. Combine some, simplify or add subordinate clauses to others. For detailed explanations of the types of sentences (simple, compound, complex), visit this link (http://www2.ivcc.edu/rambo/eng1001/sentences.htm). A short video is included at the end of the page."
let w = "23. Personal pronoun use in academic writing. Explanation: Avoid first person pronouns (I, me, my, myself, mine, we, us, our, ourselves) and second person pronouns (you, yours, yourself, yourselves) when writing literary analysis. This is a standard convention of academic writing. What to do: Eliminate the personal language. If that does not work, try using “It” constructions."
let x = "24. Sentence fragments. Explanation: Groups of words that end in a period (or other endmark) but are missing a subject or a verb. What to do: Identify what is missing: the subject, the verb, or both. Insert the subject (noun or pronoun) to show who or what is doing the action. Or, Insert the verb to show what is being done."
let y = "25. Unclear referent. Explanation: In a sentence containing persons that share the same gender, using a singular pronoun (he, him, his -or- she, her, hers) can be confusing when it is unclear who the subject is. What to do: Assign pronouns to one person; name the other individual with a proper noun or a common noun. Or, use a relative pronoun to distinguish the two individuals."
let z = "26.  Contractions. Explanation: A contraction is a shortened form of a word or phrase that is made by putting an apostrophe in the place of letters that are left out. It is an informal way of writing and speaking, and therefore inappropriate in academic composition, as they lend a casual tone to what should be formal and precise writing. The sole exception is when a contraction is in a quotation you cite. What to do: Write out the complete word or words."
